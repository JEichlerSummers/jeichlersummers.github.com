title: The User Experience of Podcasts
blurb: Headphones are a problem.
---

The UX of Podcasts has a problem and that problem is headphones. 

Podcasts are not music. Although both use headphones they are very different types of content. Music is emotional content. Podcasts are intellectual content. There is no substitute I can do without headphones to get that musical feeling. There are many non-headphone substitutes for intellectual content (<a href="https://medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a>, <a href="http://firstround.com/review" target="_blank">First Round Review</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com" target="_blank">Designer News</a>, <a href="http://jumblestream.com/?utm_source=JoshSummers&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Podcast" target="_blank">the list goes on…</a>). 

<h3>This is my full user journey as I decide to listen to a podcast:</h3>

Podcasts have 12 steps before my brain begins to get stimulated. Visual news has four. On top of this, those steps are not created equal; untangling my headphones is a lot more frustrating tapping my phone with my thumb. 

I don’t know if it means the difference in quality has to be 3x, but I do think this means that the content quality barrier for podcast adoption is much higher than that of textual adoption. High quality is hard to achieve. 

<bold>Random notes:</bold> I was recently listented to my first podcast after being told I should listen to one called <a href="http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/" target="_blank">Startup</a>. It’s about a man starting a podcasting company. It’s great! You should listen to it too if you haven’t. [Full disclosure: no one at the ‘Startup’ podcast show has any idea who I am. I just like their work.]

*There’s probably a clever way to prevent this that I don’t know.<br>
**I’m sure there are apps out there with a much better user experience. I am too lazy to find them and they haven’t found me yet.
