<span style="color: #777879">*This post is a fairly exhaustive summary of the things I learned during my recent Silicon Valley J1 trainee placement search. It is really quite long, but has been edited aggressively, and I've tried to make sure that nearly every point is either actionable, interesting, or both. If you're currently or may one day be looking for a placement as a programmer, either in San Francisco or elsewhere in the US, then there should hopefully be a bunch of useful stuff for you. I've tried to give numbers and stats where possible - your mileage will of course vary, but my hope is that they are still helpful for working out which ballpark to start in.*</span>

<hr/>

After 25 applications and 6 weeks of constant interviewing, I've finally got a J1 trainee placement in Silicon Valley.

The search experience wasn't some epic, arduous, life-affirming quest in which I realised that the nerdy girl with glasses was actually both inwardly beautiful and outwardly smoking hot when she brushed her hair. But it was certainly non-trivial and did take a lot more work and time than I had expected. As with anything, there were some things I did that accidentally turned out to be pretty smart, many things that turned out to be boneheaded, and lots of basics and finesses about making applications, doing interviews and negotiating deals that I feel I understand far more now than I did when I started. There's plenty more on these below, but there are 2 lessons I would particularly like to emphasise from the start:

Firstly, find the right level of confidence. I've spent a good deal of the last 6 months oscillating between (often multiple times in one day) the twin but completely contradictory beliefs that:

* There are trillions of people who know hundreds of times more stuff about everything than me, and anything I can do could and should be done infinitely quicker and more effectively by these savvy supermen
* I AM PROGRAMMER, KNEEL BEFORE ME AND BEG ME TO WORK WITH YOU

When written out in front of you, it's pretty clear that both these statements are somewhere between false and insane. It's equally clear that the true and healthy mindset lies somewhere between them. Unfortunately, it can be hard to remember this.

Secondly, everything becomes much easier when you accept that some people and some companies are better or worse at interviewing candidates than others, and that at this point in time it's your job to play the ball as it lies. Almost all companies do have processes that are at least better than requiring interviewees to wrestle with a chimp and hiring the survivors, and do give you a broadly sensible framework in which to demonstrate your skills. I know that there are many people who are amazing programmers but for whom current-day standard interview practises just do not and cannot work for whatever reason. This sucks a lot, and if this truly is you then perhaps there is something to be said for getting more creative or selecting primarily and aggressively for companies who you feel already understand you.

But it's just a fact that in any extensive placement search you will be asked to jump through some bizarrely shaped hoops that are leaking a strange liquid onto the carpet. You can read many posts about how most technical hiring processes are broken, and I don't disagree with them. Some places like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7260087" target="_blank">Matasano</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quora.com/Stripe-company/What-is-the-engineering-interview-process-like-at-Stripe">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blog/1269-the-github-hiring-experience" target="_blank">Github</a> and I'm sure many others are aware of this and are equally aware that it has the potential to harm their company a great deal. But until this realisation propagates throughout the entire industry, just answer any approximately reasonable questions or challenges as they come, and save your constructive bile for a blog post once you've finished. Tune in next week for mine. For now, here's some more thoughts and stories about finding and choosing your J1 placement that I hope you find useful.

<h3>0. Some quick background for reference</h3>

<h3>0.1 Me</h3>

I'm a 25 year old Ruby/Rails guy with a smattering of experience in other stacks. I did physics and then computer science at university, and have been programming for 4 years total, 2 years professionally. I did have a cheat code in the form of the noble <a href="http://peternixey.com" target="_blank">Peter Nixey</a> opening his brain to me for the year we worked together, but overall I'm adequately good at some things and completely inexperienced in others.

<h3>0.2 Timeframe and logistics</h3>

The process took 6 weeks from start to finish; 3 weeks of phone screens and 3 weeks of on-sites in San Francisco. Not already living in SF made everything a lot more intense than it would otherwise have been. I had to make sure that I blitzed all my on-site interviews in a single trip and that I actually had an offer that I wanted to take by the end of it. Having to come back to SF for another round would have been time-consuming, demoralising and not a good signal.

Flying out to interview with a single company is easy - they pay for the flights and hotel and you use them. Interviewing with 7 companies made for a surprisingly stressful round of negotiation before I'd even arrived, as I tried to spread the cost according to who could most afford it and who was getting the most time with me. I booked everything myself once I had 3-4 invitations for on-sites, guessed at how many interviews I expected to have in total and split the cost up accordingly. Fortunately all the companies were very understanding and I got reimbursed for all but around $100 of the cost of the trip.

<h3>1. Deciding where to apply</h3>

<h3>1.1 My stats</h3>

* I applied to 25 companies
* 17 asked me to do phone interviews, 8 either never replied or said no thanks straightaway
* 7 asked me to go to San Francisco for an on site interview
* 5 made me an offer

Since I was funemployed for the entirety of my J1 search, I had the time to talk to as many companies as seemed sensible. 25 applications feels like a lot, but many of these were relatively speculative, and given my geographical complications I wouldn't have felt comfortable making many fewer than this. If I had applied to half as many companies and had a couple of extra off-days then I could easily have ended up with only 1 or even 0 offers.

<h3>1.2 Be quietly confident</h3>

The internet does not do a good job of reminding you that very few people are programmatic celebrities and that you don't have to be a polyglot or a prodigy in order to be an incredibly good hire. Even if you are "just" good at building stable, maintainable and vanilla Rails apps, you are still a very rare breed.

For almost all positions, open source contributions and active StackOverflow and Github profiles are just one of many nice-to-haves. Even if you do have a bunch of projects and other content on display, they'll be used to evaluate your code quality, not your all-consuming passion for programming. Companies are aware that not everyone wants or is able to work on OSS, and if you don't have any public code then they'll just look at <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community" target="_blank">other indications of your skills</a> instead.

Equally, a popular or populated blog is just another nice-to-have. I personally felt that having ~20 essays I could point to was a great way of demonstrating to someone that I'm at least a somewhat thoughtful person before even having met them. I pushed my blog hard in my CV and cover letter, and 15-20 interviewers made a comment along the lines of "I liked your blog." I'm sure that some substantial percentage of these were just being polite (c.f. "I like your haircut") but I'm equally sure that another substantial percentage actually had read it and enjoyed it. Regardless, no matter how much writing or code or anything else you have on the internet, you will still need to show a company in person that you can write good code and will be reasonable to work with.

<h3>1.3 The J1 visa</h3>

The J1 trainee visa is an 18 month visa that allows you to train with a company in the US. You can read lots more about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-1_visa" target="_blank">here</a>. The London startup scene is strong and only getting better, but for me the opportunity to learn from the greats before coming back and starting something great in my home city is too good an opportunity to pass up.

<h3>2. Making applications</h3>

<h3>2.1 Cover letter/CV</h3>

Whilst first impressions do matter, your cover letter/CV will quickly get forgotten when you start talking code, so all they really have to do is get you in the door and maybe be a bit memorable. I liked leading with repeated references to my blog and a list of impressive yet quirky facts about me, but this might just be because I think that at the moment they are more impressive than my programming accomplishments. There are already enough pixels on the internet about how to write CVs, but I thought my cover letter in particular was pretty good and somewhat amusing, so if you're interested then <a href="/skeleton-cover-letter">here is it</a>.

<h3>2.2 Intros</h3>

Intros are fine, but far from essential. In a company of any size with a defined process you'll probably get thrown into the top of their standard trainee placement interview funnel anyway, so it doesn't seem to make much difference. I was so pleased with my skeleton cover letter that I actually preferred not to go through an intro unless it was to someone particularly senior and guaranteed to be burning hot.

<h3>2.3 Spreadsheet</h3>

Keep a spreadsheet with:

* The company name
* The date you applied
* How much you like the company (scale of 1-4, use conditional formatting to colour-code)
* The stage you are at (Applied/Phone Hello/Phone Tech/On Site/Offered)

If a company rejects you, move them to a separate list. You need to be able to see at a glance how many live applications you have and how many of them are actually interesting to you. Anything not on the above list is unnecessary and won't get updated, so will just make your spreadsheet stale and less communicative.

<h3>2.4 Inbound interest</h3>

Inbound interest is a wonderful thing that can make you feel very warm and very fuzzy, but you shouldn't be flattered into pointless conversations. Both you and the company will quickly forget who approached who, and in the end the only thing that matters is whether an opportunity is interesting to you. Would you have applied for this placement if you saw it on Hacker News? Why hadn't you already applied for it?

I had a "I'm looking for a J1" banner on my blog for about 4 months. I received 7 emails from from 5k visitors, so the conversion rate from blog hit to (generally low value) enquiry was around 0.1%.

I would therefore suggest not relying on or expecting much such freestyle inbound interest, unless you are a either a rockstar or more highly trafficked than I. That said, I was mostly writing technical and other labour-of-love posts, and it would be interesting to see what would happen if you made a 30k hit score on Hacker News.

My "Hire Me" page turned out to be most useful as a way to get people from my cover letter/CV onto my blog ("Here's some further detail on what I'm all about"), and to cram a load of impressive but only tangentially relevant info into any application. With this in mind, a "Hire Me" page and banner are very worthwhile things to do, but should not be relied on to generate inbound interest. I've <a href="/old-hire-me">left my page up for posterity</a>.

<h3>3. General Interviews</h3>

<h3>3.1 You can't waste anyone's time</h3>

If you don't have several interviews where you get completely annihilated (I had 3), then you probably didn't make enough speculative applications. It's up to a company to decide whether they want to talk to you. If they make a mistake and it takes them an hour to work out that you are actually completely unsuited for them then that's not a big deal.

<h3>3.2 Standard general questions</h3>

You will inevitably gradually evolve your answers to the standard questions:

* Tell me about yourself.
* What are you looking for in your next:
  * Product?
  * Team? (size, culture etc)
  * Technical challenge?
* Have you had experience scaling applications?
* Tell me about a cool project you worked on recently (very important).

It couldn't hurt to answer them once or twice to a friend before your first interview too.

<h3>3.3 You might think that some companies suck at interviews</h3>

But it's not worth getting upset about. At pretty much every company you will be answering a series of 45-60 min code-oriented challenges, with a few curveballs thrown in for variety. Some of these will be purely algorithmic (although very rarely a standard, rote algorithm like merge sort), and some will be more focussed on architecture. But regardless, you will spend much of your interview time writing code. If this doesn't appeal to you then, unfortunately, you will just have to get practicing.

Many companies include a 2-3 hour take-home technical challenge as part of their phone screen process. Most of them are at least somewhat interesting, and some of them are actively really fun. None of the challenges I went through took too long or seemed stupid. Even if you think they are silly and a waste of your precious and expensive time, your time has to be really valuable before it becomes sensible to refuse to give a company you are even slightly interested in some idea of how good you are at ACTUALLY writing code. So just do it.

<h3>3.4 Systems design questions</h3>

Most companies will ask a question about designing a high-level (often distributed) system - what machines would you use, how would you arrange them, how would you deal with failures, how would you set up your database etc. If, like me, you have little practical experience with this stuff, then don't lose any sleep over it. It's all surprisingly logical and non-magical, and you can stumble through the problem, learn a few things, and reach a broadly sensible answer.

<h3>3.5 The one question I will give away</h3>

It's obviously extremely unhelpful to give away interview questions, but since I was asked this clearly already non-secret systems design question an honest-to-Dog total of 6 times I will make an exception:

> "Design the infrastructure for a link-shortener."

The first time I was awful, the second time I was better, and from then on I think I sounded like the CEO of bit.ly himself.

<h3>3.6 The other question I will give away</h3>

This question also gets asked a lot, but is so open ended and useful to know about that I don't think that any company that asks it would even mind if they knew you had pre-prepared it:

> "If I type https://google.com into my browser and press enter, what happens?"

You can talk about so many things on so many levels - DNS lookup, IP lookup, client/server-side caching, SSL/TLS and many more. A fun question to answer.

<h3>3.7 Do your own write-ups</h3>

Every interviewer you speak to will be writing detailed notes on you after you finish with them, and you should do exactly the same. All you need is a document in Evernote - "FooCorp Phone Interview 1/1/14" - with details of what they asked, what you replied, whether you liked the person, whether you liked the sound of the company, the answers to any questions you asked them and what the next steps are. You will forget all of this information within a couple of hours, so do it immediately after you finish.

<h3>3.8 Find out next steps</h3>

At the end of every phone and on-site interview, make sure you know exactly what the next steps are and when they will contact you by. This will make your planning far easier and will stop you from going crazy when you haven't heard from them for a few days. It will also make it easier and less awkward for you to follow-up after any prolonged radio silence - "Steve said you'd be in touch by Thursday, just checking everything's OK your end?" feels much better than "Haven't heard from you, just wondering if you liked me, hope you did HAHAHAHA!!"

<h3>4 Phone interviews</h3>

<h3>4.1 Scheduling</h3>

Phone interviews are surprisingly tiring. Don't arrange too many in a row and make sure to give yourself breaks.

Even scheduling them is hard and time-consuming. You'll almost always be doing at least 2, maybe even 3 or 4 per company, especially if you are an international candidate and the company will need to spring a few $k just to get you on-site. Block out a few hours each day and try and fit them in there. Give people multiple time options. I'm sure you know how to schedule things effectively, so just do that.

<h3>4.2 Things to learn</h3>

Don't be thrown by Fizzbuzz:

> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

It's not a trick question, it really is as easy as it sounds, so just do it. Small gotcha: remember that `for(var i=0; i<=100; i++)` is technically wrong - you should be starting at 1, not 0.

Other common screening-type questions include the properties of common data structures (hashes, arrays, sets, trees, binary-search trees) and Big O complexities. It's worth learning that sorting a array of N elements takes `O(Nlog(N))` time, finding an element in a sorted array takes `O(log(N))` time, and that the sum of the numbers from 1 to N (the actual sum, not the time taken to calculate this sum) is `O(N^2)`. Pro-tip: the fact that Hashes have `O(1)` lookup time is often a great way to speed up an algorithm.

I subscribed to the semi-regular <a href="http://codingforinterviews.com/" target="_blank">Coding For Interviews emails</a>. They were interesting and of no harm, but I wouldn't worry about practicing puzzlers unless you haven't programmed for a while or really freeze up in interviews. It still can't hurt to briefly review depth-/breadth-first search, bit-shifting, programming language properties, and all the other things you haven't thought about since CS 101 though. Again, it may upset you that these things aren't directly related to what you'll be doing on a day-to-day basis, but it's what you're mostly going to be asked about.

<h3>5. On-site interviews</h3>

<h3>5.1 Length and energy</h3>

On-site interviews are LONG (6-9 hours). Interviewers tend to forget that whilst they are just about to start their segment, you may have not had a break for several hours. Even if you're running behind schedule, it's a waste of everyone's time if you have pillow-head (lit. - your head feels like there is a pillow inside it) so make sure you ask if it's OK if you go and grab a Mars Bar and a cool glass of milk if you need one.

<h3>5.2 Other people</h3>

At the majority of software engineering interviews, especially in larger companies, you aren't competing against other interviewees. If a company likes you, they'll make you an offer, regardless of whether they dis/like someone else. So you don't need to focus on accidentally nudging other interviewees down an elevator shaft to their doom.

<h3>5.3 Misc</h3>

The first on-site interview of your search won't necessarily be terrible, but it will be much worse than your last.

Hopefully the day includes at least 1 meal; they're the best time to get a sense of how the team interacts and whether you'd enjoy being a part of it.

<h3>6. Post-interview</h3>

<h3>6.1 References</h3>

A surprisingly large number of companies want references. Line up 2 or 3 people you have worked with (at least 1 of whom managed you) and brief them beforehand. Share a Google Spreadsheet that tells them who wants a reference, by when, and any special instructions. It can be incredibly easy to lose track of these things and waste valuable time at the crucial offer stage.

<h3>6.2 Don't worry</h3>

It's easier said than done, but don't worry about what did or didn't go well. You don't know what they were looking for, and even if you did there's no point worrying about whether they found it.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

It's a great time to be an engineer, and the J1 visa is the perfect way to gain a lot of experience very quickly in the world capital of tech. But finding the right placement still requires a lot of time and effort. Spray applications anywhere and everywhere you like the look of, and see what sticks. A little organisation will go a long way, but a little over-thinking will quickly make you go insane. How best to conduct a technical interview process is a hot and very worthwhile topic of discussion at the moment, but just go with whatever is thrown at you, regardless of what you think is and isn't a good strategy on their part. Unless you think a company is being unreasonable or exploitative, your own interview is vanishingly unlikely to be the time or the place to try and change a company's interview practises. You can always make yourself an instant hero on your first day by explaining to your interviewers in exacting detail all the ways in which they are idiots.

During your placement search you'll solve some delectable puzzles, meet some heavyweight people and see inside some very zany office spaces. You'll say some face-meltingly intelligent stuff and commit some rusty-scissor-apendectomy-esque blunders. Good luck!
