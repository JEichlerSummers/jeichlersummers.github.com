title: Will Facebook Acquire Slack? 
---

Not much to be said. But Facebook has done a very good job so far of taking the steps required to own communication. Although in the world of enterprise, Slack is killing it at communication. 

I don’t think that Slack will stay in enterprise. I don’t think the company will make the switch to something more mass - I think it will happen because Slack is that good. In a recent Designer News <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/43755-ask-dn-apart-from-dn-hn-and-ph-what-other-sites-do-you-go-to-on-a-consistent-basis" target="_blank">thread</a> that went through which websites people went to when they were bored, someone mentioned the private Slack chat’s they visited. I believe this trend will only increase - I know I’ve asked similarly minded friends to join Slack because I want to be able to chat with them casually throughout the day. 

We spend a lot of life at work - and need to communicate a lot while we’re there. Facebook knows this. They made <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/facebook-at-work-ios-android/" target="_blank">Facebook at Work</a>  for this very reason. In the same way that very few people viewed Google as a place they would go to socialise (one of the reasons I think Google Plus failed), most people don’t think of Facebook as a place that they’re going make part of their workflow. I think trying to get significant adoption in the enterprise space with the Facebook brand is naive. 

I don’t think buying Slack is.
