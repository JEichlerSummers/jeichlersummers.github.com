Moving in the opposite direction of variable rewards. 

Sometimes I find it harder to turn my computer off and go to sleep than I do to keep flicking through Hacker News, Designer News, Reddit and Twitter. Not experiencing stimulation requires effort. 

It appears I’m not alone; 36% of Americans fall asleep with their laptops next to them in bed; 75% of people under 25 do the same; 47% of Americans watch TV in bed at night; and 25% of Americans fall asleep with it on at least three nights a week. I don’t mean to pick on America (those were just the only statistics I could find). I’m confident the statistics are similar in the UK too. 

Our mushy human brains really like stimulation. It’s too bad that at no other time in history has a more sophisticated group of people had a more accurate and powerful set of tools, and as large a financial incentive to take over our free time by making us addicted to a brand-new, stimulating service.

There is a science developing behind winning over humans minds via stimulation; it’s all about variable rewards. For those not in the know, there is a theory that we are drawn to products or platforms because of their ability to generate rewards we know we will like but cannot fully expect. If you break down nearly any leisure activity you do it will fit this pattern. Television watching, tennis, Twitter and Tinder. Underneath the different type of rewards they produce, that same structure is there. (<a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/" target="_blank">Nir Eyal</a> writes a lot of very good stuff on the subject.)

When greed is in our heads we’re a really hard species to stop. I think in the same way that we ravaged the earth of its physical resources and polluted it irresponsibly over the last 150 years, we will do the same to our (and especially our user’s) minds. In fifty years from now we will start wondering why there are no externalities priced into starting a consumer facing technology startup that account for the damage they cause to our levels of concentration and anxiety.

It’s worth peering at the other end of the spectrum of stimulation to remind ourselves of the value that’s there. If you remove all (and I mean all) variable rewards - no digital interruptions, no music, no vision, no sound, no thoughts - you’re left with meditation. Something which has been proven <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ashley-turner/how-meditation-works_b_4702629.html" target="_blank">again</a> and <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-22/harvard-yoga-scientists-find-proof-of-meditation-benefit" target="_blank">again</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7319043.stm " target="_blank">again</a> to be deeply beneficial to us. 

It is strange that the absence of anything can create the most long lasting positive thing. It is worrying that we are running in the opposite direction.
