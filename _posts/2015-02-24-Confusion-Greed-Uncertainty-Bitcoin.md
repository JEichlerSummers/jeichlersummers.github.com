title: Confusion, Greed, Uncertainty and Bitcoin
blurb: How a human trait is in the way of a transactional currency.
---

To bring any virtual currency into a space where we know we’re not a gang of tech folk telling a story to ourselves it needs to reach critical adoption.  

Other tech heads think so too - ones much smarter than me! -

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>this is IMO the key graph to watch for Bitcoin adoption: <a href="https://t.co/8LVBSbrwbe">https://t.co/8LVBSbrwbe</a> (and yeah, sidechains aren&#39;t fully counted etc etc)</p>&mdash; Sam Altman (@sama) <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/569948188829831169">February 23, 2015</a></blockquote>

This is the graph of daily transaction volumes in USD that Mr Altman was linking to:

As you can see, Bitcoin is not trending towards that critical level of use. 

Although, there are good reasons why it should. Virtual currencies have highly tangible benefits over real world currencies:

* They enable a borderless monetary system with no intermediaries. This means an international transaction that currently takes several days to complete could be done in minutes.
* They cut the cost of moving funds between two parties to ~zero. Currently the fee charged to a retailer for a £100 transaction is between £0.08 (debit card) to £1.60 (high rewards credit card).
* They allow very large sums of money to be moved extremely quickly (15 min) with ~full certainty that it will arrive where it is meant to go. In terms of substantial scale capital management (we’re talking the world of investment banking here) that’s a big deal.

But yet, we’re not getting an increase in virtual currency adoption, and I believe <span style="font-weight:bold">confusion</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">greed</span> are the reasons why.

<h3>Confusion</h3>

Virtual currencies are opaque things. They're very complex, highly technical and tricky for even vaguely technically-minded individuals to grasp solidly. The higher the level of opacity in a system, the more susceptible it is to illogical decisions motivated by greed.

I’ll use my(vaguely-technically-minded)self as an example. Back in November of 2013, when Bitcoin was flying off the chart, I bought myself half a Bitcoin for ~£350.00. My investment thesis was based on my long-standing inability to understand the way that real world money is able to increasingly leverage itself. We don’t actually have the money that we think we do in our bank. It has been loaned out to people. They believe they have it in their bank accounts, but they don’t either. This is why banks die when there is a ‘run’ on them. This isn't the case with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has it’s growth controlled by an algorithm <span style="font-weight:bold">(I think!)</span>, and I had heard vague notions that this algorithm was asymptotic <span style="font-weight:bold">(perhaps!)</span>. <span style="color:#1D62F0">[This is in fact <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span> true for all virtual currencies - but more on this later.]</span> A solid hedge against the global financial system collapsing, I thought! 

I was / am an overconfident and over-lazy investor, so I didn’t do much research. But I had a lot of good feeling backing me up! Bitcoins price was rocketing. If I had some Bitcoin my bank balance would be rocketing too. <span style="font-weight:bold">I didn’t need much of a story to give myself reason to place the bet.</span>

The great thing about complex systems is that your brain gets to tell itself lots of stories about them and not have a clear understanding of their plausibility. When it comes to financial assets, our hopeful homosapien brains really like to do this. They like to do this because of a very human trait called greed.

<small style="color: #9a9a9a; line-height: 1.5em;">At the end of this article you can read how further Bitcoin complexity ended my financial adventure in an even more painful way than the market would have.</small>

<h3>Greed</h3>

I am greedy. I didn’t buy Bitcoin because I wanted to buy drugs online, a <a href="http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/campaigns/bitcoin-marketing" target="_blank">Dell computer</a> or anything for that matter, I bought it because I wanted to hold it and make money - and as we established above, the complex nature of Bitcoin means I'm easily able to tell myself a hypothesis of why this is going to happen. 

The problem is that greed doesn’t mix very well with transactional currencies that are not widely used or based in some sort of physical reality. It doesn’t mix well because it makes the future very uncertain. 

Dollars (or fridges for that matter) don’t suffer from wild price fluctuations. A quick theoretical example tells us one of the reasons why: we all have a few dollar bills (and at least one fridge) lying around the house - so it’s very unlikely that tomorrow we will wake up and be able to swap one of them for a car. The fact that we're pretty sure this will not happen removes a great deal of greed from the system; you buy a coffee with your dollars (and your spare room isn't packed with fridges). <span style="font-weight:bold">This is not quite the same for virtual currencies - at least not with Bitcoin</span>. 

Let’s compare the major price fluctuations of USD to Bitcon since 2009 with USD to GBP since the year 2000 (as far as Google Finance will let me go back).

<u>USD to Bitcoin</u><br>

* <span style="font-weight:bold">June 2010:</span> Bitcoin price rises 900% in five days ($0.008/Bt to $0.08/Bt)
* <span style="font-weight:bold">8th July - 18th Nov 2011:</span> Price falls 93% in four months and ten days (and ~50% in one day) ($30/Bt to $2/Bt)
* <span style="font-weight:bold">11th Mar - 11th Apr 2013:</span> Price rises 375% in one month ($48/Bt to $230/Bt)
* <span style="font-weight:bold">4th Nov - 4th Dec 2013:</span> Price rises 410% in one month ($225/Bt to $1,147/Bt)
* <span style="font-weight:bold">4th Dec - 7th Dec 2013:</span> Price falls 39% in three days ($1,147/Bt to $694/Bt)


<u>USD to GBP</u>
<img src="/images/usdtogbp.png" style="border:1px solid #dedede; margin-bottom:30px;">
<span style="font-weight:bold">That big jump you see is equal to a 44% increase over six months and five days</span> (£0.5/$ July 18th 2008 to £0.73/$ Jan 23rd 2009).

It’s been pretty well established that we as humans suffer from FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This FOMO goes to another level entirely if the thing you’re missing out on is several million dollars (as opposed to your next door neighbours wine and cheese themed pool party). And that’s the situation we’re in with Bitcoin. 

How are you meant to pay for a pizza with a virtual currency that could <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2013/12/23/the-bitcoin-pizza-purchase-thats-worth-7-million-today/" target="_blank">one day</a> be worth millions and millions of dollars? You can’t. 

How do you know if you should buy something with the virtual currency you own if a guy who bought his Bitcoins for $27 was later able to trade a fifth of them in for a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/29/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home" target="_blank">plush flat</a> in Oslo? You can’t. 

If you’re a business, how are you meant to make any sort of solid financial projections with a currency that’s value can rise over 400% in a month, and fall over 40% in three days? You can’t.

In it’s current state, greed breaks Bitcoin as a transactional currency and I believe that’s one of the main reasons why we’re not moving closer to critical adoption. 

<h3 style="color:#1D62F0">Perhaps, Perhaps</h3>

Note: Welcome to the world of my speculations...

So to solve Bitcoin (or a different virtual currency) one of the main adjustments that needs to happen is that greed needs to be removed from the equation - and, as far as I understand it, that might be a realistic possibility.

As I mentioned previously, virtual currencies do <span style="font-weight:bold">not</span> have to have a cap on their quantity. The number Bitcoin’s might be limited by an asymptotic algorithm but after a recent talk with the very bright Jutta Steiner who works for the blockchain focused <a href="https://ethereum.org/"  target="_blank">Ethereum Project</a> I learnt that that can be manipulated by changing the algorithm the currency runs on. 

It is possible to have an opening in a virtual currency’s algorithm which allows any number of coins to be killed or created at any given time (or something like that). If this opening was filled with with another algorithm - one that constantly kept the value of the virtual currency on a par with the USD (or some other major currency) - there would be no doubt about the future value of the currency. 

I am not the most technically minded man about town, so I don’t know if this is actually possible. However, if it is, it would remove greed from the equation and let a virtual currency become a transactional currency - enabling us to make use of the tangible benefits we all would benefit from.

I’m curious, so if you know the answer to this, please let me know! Tweet <a href="http://deeplink.me/twitter.com/joshsummersblog">@JoshSummersBlog</a>. [Link will open in Twitter app if on mobile.]

<u>The sad end to my Bitcoin adventure</u><br>
Not only was my bet wrong, but my understanding of virtual wallets was wrong too! After my hard drive crashed and the man at Apple told me he would have to wipe it - I quickly learnt that I had lost my little bit of Bitcoin. Fingers crossed the global financial system stays strong.
